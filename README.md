# PYTHON: CREDIT RATING PERFORMANCE

# OVERVIEW

This project analyzes a  consumer loan dataset from KAGGLE  to evaluate the performance of the internal credit rating system (`sub_grade`).

The main objective is to assess whether the rating grades (from A1 to G5) effectively discriminate credit risk by examining actual

(`default rates`)(Charged Off loans) across different grades.

# III. Recommendations

Default Rate: Enhance debt recovery and lending processes, particularly for low-income segments, with tailored policies for different risk groups.

Credit Grade: Tighten underwriting criteria and verification, while establishing a standardized interest rate framework for each grade.

System Scale: Improve predictive quality by adding payment/transaction history or transitioning to a point-based scoring system.
